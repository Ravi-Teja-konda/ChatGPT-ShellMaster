ChatGPT ShellMaster is a cross-platform (unix/linux) plugin that brings command-line interactions right into chat using OpenAI's ChatGPT 4. This powerful tool enables you to run scripts, manage or create files, and monitor processes directly from your chat interface.

The command line, or terminal, is an incredibly powerful tool for any developer. With a wide range of commands at your disposal, you can manipulate files, manage system processes, connect to remote servers, and much more. Despite its power, the command line can often be a challenging and intimidating environment, particularly for those new to it.

That's where ChatGPT ShellMaster comes in. It brings the power of the terminal to the more familiar and intuitive environment of chat. Tasks such as debugging and file analysis become more interactive and engaging. By using a language model trained on a diverse range of internet text, it can even provide helpful suggestions and explainers, guiding you as you work.

"Please note that access to a developer account and ChatGPT Plus are required to use this plugin. And as with all powerful tools, remember to use this responsibly, keeping in mind the security implications."

## Features
- Execute any Linux/Unix command directly from the ChatGPT interface, effectively transforming your chat into a powerful command-line interface.
- Commands are executed asynchronously, allowing for efficient handling of multiple commands simultaneously, which can greatly aid in debugging and monitoring tasks.
- Fetch files with commands like wget, analyze them, and store the results - all interactively from your chat.
- The working directory for command execution can be configured, providing flexibility while maintaining security precautions.
- Designed to work with temporary directories, enhancing security and reducing the risk of unintentional file manipulation.

## Installation
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install the required Python modules.

```bash
pip install quart
pip install quart-cors
````
Configure the working directory for command execution by editing the settings.json file. The default is /tmp, which is recommended for its safety and security. However, you can modify it as per your needs, ensuring the new directory has a minimum chmod of 700.

## Usage
To get started, run the plugin using the following command:

```python
python3 main.py
```
Next, navigate to your ChatGPT Plus Account. Under Settings, enable the Developer Tools ([see image for reference](img/settings.png)). Switch to the GPT-4 tab and then proceed to the Plugin Store. At the bottom of the Plugin Store page, you'll find a link titled "Develop your own plugin" ([see image](img/pluginshop.png)). Click on this link and enter your information as required.

In my example, I used localhost:5004. You can use another port such as 2323 or 8080, but please ensure that your firewall or security software isn't blocking the connection ([see image](img/load.png)).

To use this plugin, you'll need to send a POST request to the /command endpoint of the server. The request should contain a JSON body with a command field, representing the command you wish to execute.

Example:
```json
{
  "command": "echo 'Hello, World!'"
}
```
Alternatively, you can simplify your workflow by directly instructing ChatGPT, saying: "You have access to my CLI, please execute ...". The rest will be taken care of for you!

The server will execute the command and return the output. If the command fails, the server will return an error message.

## Security
Please be aware that this plugin executes commands as-is, without any sanitization or security checks. Make sure to only use it in a secure and controlled environment, and do not expose the server to the public internet. This ChatGPT Plugin is designed for developers, and should not be deployed on production servers! Use it only on localhost!
