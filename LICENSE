"Help the World Grow" License
This project is a gift to the world. It's free and open-source. You are permitted to use it for private and commercial purposes, modify it, and distribute it.

The world needs free resources to grow and evolve. Often, it's people like me who invest their time and heart into projects, making them accessible for everyone. But free development is not easy and requires support.

If you find this project useful and you use it for commercial purposes where you make a financial profit, please consider giving something back. Even if it's only a small contribution, it helps to finance the ongoing development and enables me and other developers to continue sharing our work.

The generosity and support of the community allow this kind of project to thrive. Every gift, no matter its size, is deeply appreciated and helps make the world a little bit better.

All gifts are used to support my free projects such as [JADE](https://jugendamt-deutschland.de) and JADE Advisor.
