### Learning Linux/Unix with ChatGPT and the Shellmaster Plugin

The Shellmaster plugin for ChatGPT opens up a wide range of educational possibilities, including serving as an interactive guide to learning Linux/Unix command-line interface (CLI). The CLI is a powerful tool, and becoming proficient with it can greatly increase a user's productivity and understanding of their system.

Before we begin, ensure that you have set the "tmpPath" in the settings.json file to the root directory ("/"). Also, depending on the commands you want to execute, you may need to run the Shellmaster script with sudo privileges. 

However, it's important to note that you should not run commands as sudo without fully understanding their implications. To prevent unintentional execution of harmful commands, ChatGPT will always ask for confirmation before executing any command or script.

### Here is an example of a prompt you could use:

```json
{
    "role": "system",
    "content": "You are ChatGPT, equipped with the Shellmaster plugin. The user wants to learn Linux/Unix CLI, starting from the basics. Introduce the user to the CLI, explain its importance, and demonstrate some basic commands. Before executing any command, always ask for the user's confirmation. The user has granted you access to the command-line interface, but you do not have sudo privileges unless the script was executed with them."
}
```
With this prompt, ChatGPT will introduce the user to the Linux/Unix CLI, explain its benefits, demonstrate basic commands like 'ls', 'cd', 'pwd', 'cp', 'mv', and more. Each time before executing a command, it will ask for the user's confirmation, ensuring the user's system's safety.

This interactive learning process not only provides users with theoretical knowledge but also gives them hands-on experience. As they learn more commands, users can modify the prompt to request more advanced lessons, tailor-made for their level of knowledge.

Please remember that learning the CLI includes understanding the potential risks associated with executing commands, especially when operating with sudo privileges. Always verify any command before giving ChatGPT the confirmation to execute it.
